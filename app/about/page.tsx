            Hi, I'm <strong>Manas Anand Singh</strong> a self-taught Web
            developer passionate about building interactive, minimalist user
            interfaces.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, slowly diving into
            building real-world projects with <strong>React</strong>. Over time,
            I became obsessed with animations now exploring{" "}
            <strong>Framer Motion</strong> and <strong>Anime.js</strong> to
            bring smooth, expressive UI to life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Iâ€™m currently learning <strong>advanced React patterns</strong>,
            reusable component design, and end-to-end app development using{" "}
            <strong>Next.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also focus deeply on Data Structures and Algorithms solving
            problems daily on <strong>LeetCode</strong> and following{" "}
            <strong>Striverâ€™s DSA roadmap</strong> to build a strong
            problem-solving mindset.
          </p>

          <p>
            My learning approach is highly project-based. Whether it's
            animation-heavy portfolios, dashboards, or full-stack applications I
            build to truly understand.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy simplifying complex problems and translating them into
            clean, accessible UI. Iâ€™m constantly pushing my limits to create
            performant, creative, and impactful user experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably sketching ideas, writing notes,
            building my component library, or exploring new frameworks and dev
            tools.
          </p>
          <p className="italic text-sm">
            Fun fact: I love breaking down complex problems and animating ideas
            to life.
          </p>
